DISCLAIMER: I take no responsiblity for loss of files or other data which may come as a result of the usage of this program.

How to use: place subtitle files and videos in the same folder. Both the videos and subtitles must have SxxExx somewhere in the title (1 or 2 digits for episode and series numbers). Acceptable names would include: randomShowS01E03.mkv, randomShowS3E4.mp4, etc. The program must then be placed in the same folder and run (either EXE or py file will do the same thing but I created the EXE to allow it to be run on systems without python installed).

Notes:
- The program will not distinguish between different shows etc. Any subtitle files with a season and episode number will be renamed, regardless of the rest of the filename.
- Please make sure only files you wish to be modified are in the folder with the program when it is run.
- Once again, I take no responsibility for the integrity of your files. Feel free to read over the source code and verify it's functionality yourself if you have important data.
